        <h4>Can you donate to our campaign to build fairer and greener communities across England and Wales?</h4>
        <p>On May 5th, about half of all local authorities will have elections. In some places, it will be the first time in years 
        voters have been able to choose their local councillors.</p>
        <p>Greens are contesting seats in over 100 local areas, expecting to make sizeable gains as 
            <h4>the only party with the policies we need to transform England and Wales and make our future Greener, fairer and safer.</h4></p>
        <p>Green councillors stand up for their local communities, work hard on their behalf and listen to their needs. We are the only party that put 
            both nature and local communities at the heart of our policies.</p>
            From calling the first Climate Emergency Declaration in Bristol, to housing unaccompanied asylum seeking children in Brighton and Hove, 
            to retrofitting 40,000 social homes in Lewes, and disinvesting from fossil fuels in Merseyside Pension Funds, <h4>Greens are building 
            resilient local communities.</h4>
        <p>Each of the major parties will spend millions on the election. We are not funded by big business and the trade unions. Our campaign is 
            people powered and we need your help to get more Greens elected.</p>
