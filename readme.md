# Cloning Green Party Website

Err. I've been postponing since forever, but I'll finally begin cloning greenparty.org.uk today. 
I guess the hardest part of everything is starting it, so congratulations to me for starting. I hope I finish well. I'll be doing the HTML alone first. Let's see how that goes. 

I'll go commit now.
